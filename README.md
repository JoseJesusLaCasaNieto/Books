# Books

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks based on various programming books I have been reading. Each notebook serves as a summary of key concepts, practical exercises, and examples presented in these books. The purpose of this collection is to document my learning journey and to provide a resource for others interested in similar topics.

## Structure

Each folder within the repository corresponds to a different book and contains:

- Jupyter Notebooks with explanations and exercises inspired by the book.
- Notes and Comments to clarify complex concepts and enhance understanding.

## Books covered

The repository currently includes content from the following books:

- Aprende Machine Learning - Juan Ignacio Bagnato
- Hands On Machine Learning - Aurélien Geron
- Hands On Reinforcement Learning - Sudharsan Ravichandiran
- Hands On Reinforcement Learning for Games - Micheal Lanham
- Introduction To Machine Learning - Andreas Müller
- Practical Machine Learning for Computer Vision - Valliappa Lakshmanan
