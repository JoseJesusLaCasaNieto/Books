# Books

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks based on various programming books I have been reading. Each notebook serves as a summary of key concepts, practical exercises, and examples presented in these books. The purpose of this collection is to document my learning journey and to provide a resource for others interested in similar topics.

## Structure

Each folder within the repository corresponds to a different book and contains:

- Jupyter Notebooks with explanations and exercises inspired by the book.
- Notes and Comments to clarify complex concepts and enhance understanding.

## Books covered

This list will continue to grow as I progress through more books.

## How to use this repository

Feel free to explore the notebooks to understand the fundamental concepts each book covers. If youâ€™re reading the same books or interested in programming topics, these notebooks can serve as supplementary resources.
